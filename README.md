# Maze-Solver-using-DFS-BFS-
A program that takes a maze as input (grid of cells with walls and paths) and finds the shortest path from the start to the end using either Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS).

Features
1. Input a maze represented as a 2D grid where:
        0 represents an open path.
        1 represents a wall.
2. Specify the start and end coordinates.
3. Implement DFS and BFS to solve the maze.
4. Highlight the path found, either numerically (e.g., 2) or graphically in a console/grid output.
